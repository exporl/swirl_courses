  Author: Nick Carchedi / Swirl Coders / Sara Herrebosch
  Type: Standard
  Organization: JHU Biostatistics / Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health / KU Leuven
  Version: 1.0.0

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, we will discuss type I and type II errors as well as the
    closely related concepts of power and sample size calculation.

- Class: text
  Output: A type I error, also known as a false positive, is the probability of rejecting
    the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true. When performing a statistical
    test, the type I error rate is typically predetermined by the statistician performing
    the test and is equivalent to the significance level of the test. Type I error
    is generally represented by the Greek letter 'alpha'.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Another name for a type I error is ___________.
  AnswerChoices: beta; true positive; false negative; alpha
  CorrectAnswer: alpha
  AnswerTests: word= alpha
  Hint: Review the previous paragraph.

- Class: text
  Output: On the other hand, a type II error, also known as a false negative, is the
    probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis
    is false. Notice that we intentionally avoid saying that one 'accepts the null
    hypothesis' in favor of saying that one 'fails to reject the null hypothesis'.
    This is comparable to the way in which a court of law avoids declaring someone
    to be innocent in favor of declaring someone to be not guilty. Type II error is
    generally represented by the Greek letter 'beta'.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Another name for a type II error is ___________.
  AnswerChoices: false positive; false negative; alpha; true positive
  CorrectAnswer: false negative
  AnswerTests: word= false negative
  Hint: Review the previous paragraph.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The concept of power is closely related to that of a type II error. Power
    is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis
    is false. Since the type II error rate is the probability of INCORRECTLY failing to
    reject the null hypothesis and power is the probability of CORRECTLY rejecting the null
    hypothesis, power is therefore equal to one minus the type II error rate (or in
    mathematical terms, power = 1 - beta). '

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Another name for power is ___________.
  AnswerChoices: true positive; beta; true negative; false negative
  CorrectAnswer: true positive
  AnswerTests: word= true positive
  Hint: Power is the probability of CORRECTLY detecting something (i.e. having a 'positive'
    test result).

- Class: text
  Output: You are part of a research team conducting an experiment on the effectiveness
    of a new test that is designed to detect the presence of a deadly disease. Existing
    methods of detecting this disease are extremely reliable, but also very expensive.
    The appeal of this new test is that it is significantly cheaper than the existing
    method, although it may not be quite as reliable.

- Class: text
  Output: 'To estabilish the validity of your new test, your team performs both the
    new test and the existing test on a large group of consenting individuals. It
    is assumed that the diagnosis given by the existing test is the true diagnosis.
    The new test performs as follows: Among people who actually have the disease (as
    diagnosed by the existing test) the new test correctly diagnoses 80% as having
    the disease and fails to correctly diagnose the remaining 20%. Among people who
    do not have the disease, the new test incorrectly diagnoses 4% as having the disease
    and correctly diagnoses the remaining 96% as not having the disease. Keep in mind
    that when performing a diagnostic test, the null hypothesis is always that the
    patient does not have the disease of interest.'

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the type I error of this test?
  AnswerChoices: 80%; 20%; 4%; 96%
  CorrectAnswer: 4%
  AnswerTests: word= 4%
  Hint: Type I error is the probability of incorrectly diagnosing someone as having
    the disease when she is in fact healthy.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the type II error of this test?
  AnswerChoices: 80%; 20%; 4%; 96%
  CorrectAnswer: 20%
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= 20%
  Hint: Type II error is the probability of incorrectly diagnosing someone as healthy
    when he does in fact have the disease.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the power of this test?
  AnswerChoices: 80%; 20%; 4%; 96%
  CorrectAnswer: 80%
  AnswerTests: word= 80%
  Hint: Power is the probability of correctly diagnosing someone as having the disease
    when she does in fact have the disease.

- Class: text
  Output: For the remainder of the lesson, we will shift our focus to power and its
    important role in sample size calculations for experiments.

- Class: text
  Output: In the lecture, you learned how to compute power given a large sample size
    and a known population standard deviation (or sigma). This is an important calculation
    to understand, we will get back to this later on in this lesson.

- Class: text
  Output: For now, our focus will be on reversing this calculation to compute the
    sample size required to achieve a desired level of power (again, given a known
    sigma.) This calculation is most commonly used when designing experiments in order
    to ensure sample size is large enough to guarantee a powerful result.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Note that assuming a known sigma allows us to use the standard normal distribution
    in place of the t-distribution. We make this simplifying assumption here for the
    sake of conveying the concept at hand.'

- Class: text
  Output: 'Here are the values we need for our first sample size calculation: population
    standard deviation (sigma), the difference in means we''d like to be able to detect
    (delta), the z-critical value for our chosen significance level, and the z-critical
    value corresponding to our desired level of power.'

- Class: text
  Output: Let's work through an example. Pretend a road by your house has a posted
    speed limit of 65 miles per hour. You are interested in knowing if the true average
    speed at which cars travel on this road during rush hour is greater than or equal
    to 5 miles per hour ABOVE the speed limit (delta). To determine this, you will
    measure the speed at which a random selection of cars passes you on the road during
    rush hour. Assume a significance level of 0.05 (alpha) and that the population
    standard deviation in speed among all cars at this time is 10 miles per hour (sigma).
    Let's determine how many cars you will need to record so that you have an 80%
    chance of detecting a true difference of 5 or more miles per hour (power).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: For this experiment, are we interested in a one-sided or two-sided test?
  AnswerChoices: One-sided; Two-sided; Neither, that's a trick question!
  CorrectAnswer: One-sided
  AnswerTests: word= One-sided
  Hint: In this example, are you interested in knowing whether cars are travelling
    at speeds lower than the posted speed limit?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's define the variables we'll use in our sample size calculation.
    Assign the appropriate value to a new variable called 'sigma'.
  CorrectAnswer: sigma <- 10
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=sigma <- 10
  Hint: Sigma represents the true population standard deviation of speeds.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Assign the appropriate value to a new variable called 'delta'.
  CorrectAnswer: delta <- 5
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=delta <- 5
  Hint: Delta represents the difference in true average speeds that you would like
    to be able to detect.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since our significance level is 0.05, we need to find the z-critical value
    for which 5% of the standard normal distribution lies above it. In other words,
    95% of the standard normal distribution falls below this point. This '95th percentile'
    is also called a '0.95 quantile', and is thus found with the 'qnorm' function
    in R ('q' for 'quantile' and 'norm' for 'normal'). Use this function now on the
    value 0.95 and assign the result to a new variable called 'zAlpha'.
  CorrectAnswer: zAlpha <- qnorm(0.95)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=zAlpha <- qnorm(0.95)
  Hint: Type 'qnorm(0.95)' to find the value of the 0.95 quantile.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Since our desired power level is 80%, that means that we want to design
    our study in such a way that we have an 80% chance of correctly rejecting our
    null hypothesis. Thus our corresponding z-critical value should have 80% of the
    standard normal distribution lying above it and hence 20% below it. Use the 'qnorm'
    function again to find the 20th percentile and assign the result to a new variable
    called 'zBeta'.
  CorrectAnswer: zBeta <- qnorm(0.20)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=zBeta <- qnorm(0.20)
  Hint: The 20th percentile is also known as the 0.20 quantile and can be found in
    the same way as you found the 0.95 quantile above.

- Class: text
  Output: We now have everything we need to compute our required sample size. Since
    it's a bit challenging to express the sample size formula in words, I'm going
    to give you the code for computing it below.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'To compute the sample size required to achieve 80% power in our example,
    type the following: ''(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2''. Note that ''x^2''
    is R notation for ''x-squared'' or ''x to the power of 2''.'
  CorrectAnswer: (sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2
  Hint: Type '(sigma / delta)^2 * (zAlpha - zBeta)^2' and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Good job! As you can see, we need to measure the speed of at least 25 cars to obtain a power of 80%.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that you've computed the required sample size manually, let's perform
    the same task using a function from the R package called 'pwr'. In case you're
    new to R packages, they are simply libraries of additional functions that people
    like you have created for everyone to use. Normally,  you would have to load a
    new package on your own using the 'library' function, but for simplicity we have
    already done this for you here.

- Class: text
  Output: 'The function we will use is called ''pwr.norm.test'' and it will automatically
    generate the sample size required for 80% power once we specify the necessary
    information. Here are the items we need to give it: effect size (which is the
    difference we wish to detect divided by sigma), significance level, power, and
    whether we are conducting a one- or two-sided test.'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, compute the effect size using the variables 'delta' and 'sigma',
    both of which you've already computed. Save the result in a new variable called
    'effectSize'.
  CorrectAnswer: effectSize <- delta / sigma
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=effectSize <- delta / sigma
  Hint: Divide 'delta' by 'sigma' and assign the result to a new variable called 'effectSize'.

- Class: text
  Output: We already know the significance and power levels that we want and we are
    interested in a one-sided test. In this case, our one-sided test applies only
    to the case when the true speed is GREATER or equal to 5 miles per hour above
    the posted speed limit. Therefore, we will specifiy the test type as "greater".

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'You now have everything you need to call the ''pwr.norm.test'' function.
    Here is the format: ''pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80,
    alternative="greater")''. Enter this now.'
  CorrectAnswer: pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative="greater")
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd=pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative="greater")
  Hint: Type 'pwr.norm.test(d=effectSize, sig.level=0.05, power=0.80, alternative="greater")'
    and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: This function provides several items of interest, but the only one we are
    concerned with here is the value of 'n', which is our sample size required to
    achieve a power of 80% in this scenario. You'll notice that it perfectly matches
    the result you got when doing the manual calculation.

- Class: text
  Output: Since the sample size is reported as a decimal number, it is good practice
    to round up to the nearest whole number since we generally can't study a fraction
    of a car (person, mouse, etc.)

- Class: text
  Output: Up until this point, we've assumed a known population standard deviation
    (sigma). Sometimes this is available if a subject has been studied extensively,
    but this may often not be the case. If you are required to compute sigma from
    the data, then using a t-test is more appropriate. Nevertheless, we will not discuss this type of calculations in this lesson.

- Class: text
  Output: Now, we'll further discuss POWER, which  is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, which is good and proper.

- Class: text
  Output: Hence you want more POWER.

- Class: text
  Output: Power comes into play when you're designing an experiment, and in particular, if you're trying to determine if a null result (failing to reject a null hypothesis) is meaningful. For instance, you might have to determine if your sample size was big enough to yield a meaningful, rather than random, result.

- Class: text
  Output: Power gives you the opportunity to detect if your ALTERNATIVE hypothesis is true.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Do you recall the definition of a Type II error?  Remember, errors are bad.
  AnswerChoices: Rejecting a true null hypothesis; Accepting a false null hypothesis; Miscalculating a t score; Misspelling the word hypothesis
  CorrectAnswer: Accepting a false null hypothesis
  AnswerTests: word= Accepting a false null hypothesis
  Hint: Take the courtroom as an example. Letting a guilty person walk, accepting the null hypothesis of innocence, is a Type II error.

- Class: text
  Output: Beta is the probability of a Type II error, accepting a false null hypothesis;  the complement of this is obviously (1 - beta) which represents the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. This is good and this is POWER!

- Class: text
  Output: We'll consider the following example. A respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of more than 30 events / hour is considered evidence of severe sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Suppose that in a sample of 100 overweight subjects with other risk factors for SDB at a sleep clinic, the mean RDI (X') was 32 events / hour with a standard deviation (s) of 10 events / hour.

- Class: text
  Output: We want to test the null hypothesis H_0 that mu = 30. Our alternative hypothesis H_a is mu>30. Here mu represents the hypothesized population mean RDI.

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we're testing a null hypothesis H_0 with an alpha level of .05. Since H_a proposes that mu > 30 (the mean hypothesized by H_0), power is the probability that the true mean mu is greater than the (1-alpha) quantile or qnorm(.95). For  simplicity, assume  we're working with normal distributions of which we know the variances.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's a picture representing hypothesis testing. The shaded portion represents 5% of the area under the curve. If a test statistic fell in this shaded portion we would reject H_0  because the sample mean is too far from the mean (center) of the distribution hypothesized by H_0. Instead we would favor H_a, that  mu > 30. This happens with probability .05.
  Figure: conf_5pct.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: text
  Output: You might well ask, "What does this have to do with POWER?" Good question. We'll look at some pictures to show you.

- Class: text
  Output: First we have to emphasize a key point. The two hypotheses, H_0 and H_a, actually represent two distributions since they're talking about means or centers of distributions. H_0 says that the mean is mu_0 (30 in our example) and H_a says that the mean is mu_a.

- Class: text
  Output: We're assuming normality and equal variance, say sigma^2/n, for both hypotheses, so under H_0, X'~ N(mu_0, sigma^2/n) and under H_a, X'~ N(mu_a, sigma^2/n).

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's a picture with the two distributions. We've drawn a vertical line at our favorite spot, at the 95th percentile of the red distribution. To the right of the line lies 5% of the red distribution.
  Figure: twoDistros.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Quick quiz! Which distribution represents H_0?
  AnswerChoices: the red; the blue
  CorrectAnswer:  the red
  AnswerTests: word=the red
  Hint:  The two distributions have the same spread (variance). They differ in their means (centers). Which has a mean equal to that hypothesized by H_0?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which distribution represents H_a?
  AnswerChoices: the red; the blue
  CorrectAnswer:  the blue
  AnswerTests: word=the blue
  Hint:  The two distributions have the same spread (variance). They differ in their means (centers). Which has a mean different than that hypothesized by H_0?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: From the picture, what is the mean proposed by H_a?
  AnswerChoices: 30; 28; 32; 36;
  CorrectAnswer:  32
  AnswerTests: word=32
  Hint:  At what value of mu does does the center (highest point) of the blue distribution fall?

- Class: text
  Output: See how much of the blue distribution lies to the right of that big vertical line?

- Class: text
  Output: That, my friend, is POWER!

- Class: text
  Output: It's the area under the blue curve (H_a) to the right of the vertical line.

- Class: figure
  Output: Note that the placement of the vertical line depends on the null distribution. Here's another picture with fatter distributions. The vertical line is still at the 95th percentile of the null (red) distribution and 5% of the distribution still lies to its right. The line is calibrated to mu_0 and the variance.
  Figure: twoDistros_fat.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: figure
  Output: Back to our original picture.
  Figure: twoDistros.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  Now we will adjust our plot, so you can see H_a in action. We've fixed mu_0 at 30, sigma (standard deviation) at 4 and n (sample size) at 16. The function myplot just needs an alternative mean, mu_a, as argument. Run myplot now with an argument of 34 to see what it does.
  CorrectAnswer: myplot(34)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= myplot(34)
  Hint: Type myplot(34) at the command prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  The distribution represented by H_a moved to the right, so almost all (100%) of the blue curve is to the right of the vertical line, indicating that with mu_a=34, the test is more powerful, i.e., there's a higher probability that it's correct to reject the null hypothesis since it appears false. Now try myplot with an argument of 33.3.
  CorrectAnswer: myplot(33.3)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= myplot(33.3)
  Hint: Type myplot(33.3) at the command prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  This isn't as powerful as the test with mu_a=34 but it makes a pretty picture. Now try myplot with an argument of 30.
  CorrectAnswer: myplot(30)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= myplot(30)
  Hint: Type myplot(30) at the command prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: Uh Oh! Did the red curve disappear? No. it's just under the blue curve. The power now, the area under the blue curve to the right of the line, is exactly 5% or alpha!

- Class: text
  Output: So what did we learn?

- Class: text
  Output: First, power is a function that depends on a specific value of an alternative mean, mu_a, which is any value greater than mu_0, the mean hypothesized by H_0. (Recall that H_a specified mu>30.)

- Class: text
  Output: Second, if mu_a is much bigger than mu_0=30 then the power (probability) is bigger than if mu_a is close to 30. As mu_a approaches 30, the mean under H_0, the power approaches alpha.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  Just for fun try myplot with   an argument of 28.
  CorrectAnswer: myplot(28)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= myplot(28)
  Hint: Type myplot(28) at the command prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: We see that the blue curve has moved to the left of the red, so the area under it, to the right of the line, is less than the 5% under the red curve. This then is even less powerful and contradicts H_a so it's not worth looking at.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's a picture of the power curves for different sample sizes. The alternative means, the mu_a's, are plotted along the horizontal axis and power along the vertical.
  Figure: powerCurve_n.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the graph show us about mu_a?
  AnswerChoices: as it gets bigger, it gets more powerful; as it gets bigger, it gets less powerful; power is independent of mu_a
  CorrectAnswer: as it gets bigger, it gets more powerful
  AnswerTests: word=as it gets bigger, it gets more powerful
  Hint: As you move to the right along the horizontal axis, does the line go up or down?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the graph show us about sample size?
  AnswerChoices: as it gets bigger, it gets more powerful; as it gets bigger, it gets less powerful; power is independent of sample size
  CorrectAnswer: as it gets bigger, it gets more powerful
  AnswerTests: word=as it gets bigger, it gets more powerful
  Hint: You have to check the color key. The purple line represents a bigger sample size than the red or blue. This purple line goes up faster than any of the other lines.

- Class: text
  Output: Now back to numbers. Our test for determining rejection of H_0 involved comparing a test statistic, namely Z=(X'-30)/(sigma/sqrt(n)), against some quantile, say Z_95, which depended on our level size alpha (.05 in this case). H_a proposed that mu > mu_0, so we tested if Z>Z_95.  This is equivalent to X' > Z_95 * (sigma/sqrt(n)) + 30, right?

- Class: text
  Output: There exists an R function "pnorm", which gives us the probability that a value drawn from a normal distribution is greater or less than/equal to a specified quantile argument depending on the flag "lower.tail". If lower.tail=TRUE, this gives us the probability that a random draw from the distribution is less than or equal to the argument. If lower.tail=FALSE, this gives us the probability that a random draw from the distribution is greater than the argument. The function also takes a mean and standard deviation as arguments.

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose we call pnorm with the quantile 30 + Z_95 * (sigma/sqrt(n)) and specify mu_a as our mean argument. This would return a probability which we can interpret as POWER. Why?

- Class: figure
  Output: Recall our picture of two distributions. 30 + Z_95 * (sigma/sqrt(n)) represents the point at which our vertical line falls. It's the point on the null distribution at the (1-alpha) level.
  Figure: twoDistros.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Study this picture. Calling pnorm with 30 + Z_95 * (sigma/sqrt(n)) as the quantile and mu_a, say 32, as the mean and lower.tail=FALSE does what?
  AnswerChoices: returns the area under the blue curve to the right of the line; returns the area under the blue curve to the left of the line; returns the area under the red curve to the right of the line; returns the area under the red curve to the left of the line
  CorrectAnswer: returns the area under the blue curve to the right of the line
  AnswerTests: word=returns the area under the blue curve to the right of the line
  Hint: The argument lower.tail=FALSE is a big clue. It indicates we should look to the right of a line. The mean argument is the second clue. It specifies which distribution (red or blue) to examine.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Let's try some examples now. Before we do, what do we know pnorm will return if we specify a quantile less than the mean?
  AnswerChoices: an answer less than .50; an answer dependent on alpha; an answer dependent on beta; an answer greater than 1
  CorrectAnswer: an answer less than .50
  AnswerTests: word=an answer less than .50
  Hint: There are several red herrings in the choices. First pnorm will NEVER return a value greater than 1 because density functions by definition have areas equal to 1. We haven't specified an alpha or beta either. The function pnorm just needs a quantile, mean, and standard deviation. By default it looks at the lower tail of the distribution. That leaves one choice.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, define a variable z as qnorm(.95)
  CorrectAnswer: z <- qnorm(.95)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= z <- qnorm(.95)
  Hint: Type z <- qnorm(.95) at the command prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run pnorm now with the quantile 30+z, mean=30, and lower.tail=FALSE. We've specified sigma and n so that the standard deviation of the sample mean is 1.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(30+z,mean=30,lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= pnorm(30+z,mean=30,lower.tail=FALSE)
  Hint: Type pnorm(30+z,mean=30,lower.tail=FALSE) at the command prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: That's not surprising, is it? With the mean set to mu_0 the two distributions, null and alternative, are the same and power=alpha. Now run pnorm now with the quantile 30+z, mean=32, and lower.tail=FALSE.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(30+z,mean=32,lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= pnorm(30+z,mean=32,lower.tail=FALSE)
  Hint: Type pnorm(30+z,mean=32,lower.tail=FALSE) at the command prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: See how this is much more powerful? 64% as opposed to 5%. When the sample mean is quite different from (many standard errors greater than)  the mean hypothesized by the null hypothesis, the probability of rejecting H_0 when it is false is much higher. That is power!

- Class: figure
  Output: Let's look again at the portly distributions.
  Figure: twoDistros_fat.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: With this standard deviation=2 (fatter distribution) will power be greater or less than with the standard deviation=1?
  AnswerChoices: greater; less than; the same
  CorrectAnswer:  less than
  AnswerTests: word=less than
  Hint:  A greater standard deviation means more variability in the data so the test will be less powerful.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  To see this, run pnorm now with the quantile 30+z, mean=32 and sd=1. Don't forget to set lower.tail=FALSE so you get the right tail.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(30+z,mean=32,sd=1,lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= pnorm(30+z,mean=32,sd=1,lower.tail=FALSE)
  Hint: Type pnorm(30+z,mean=32,sd=1,lower.tail=FALSE) at the command prompt.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  Now run pnorm with the quantile 30+z*2, mean=32 and sd=2. Don't forget to set lower.tail=FALSE so you get the right tail.
  CorrectAnswer: pnorm(30+z*2,mean=32,sd=2,lower.tail=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: swirl1cmd= pnorm(30+z*2,mean=32,sd=2,lower.tail=FALSE)
  Hint: Type pnorm(30+z*2,mean=32,sd=2,lower.tail=FALSE) at the command prompt.

  Output: See the power drain from 64% to 26% ? Let's review some basic facts about power. We saw before in our pictures that the power of the test depends on mu_a. When H_a specifies that mu > mu_0, then as mu_a grows and exceeds mu_0 increasingly, what happens to power?
  AnswerChoices: it increases; it decreases; it doesn't change
  CorrectAnswer: it increases
  AnswerTests: word=it increases
  Hint: Remember the different distributions and running pnorm? As mu_a got bigger so did the pnorm result.

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's another question. Recall our power curves from before.
  Figure: powerCurve_n.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: As the sample size increases, what happens to power?
  AnswerChoices: it increases; it decreases; it doesn't change
  CorrectAnswer: it increases
  AnswerTests: word=it increases
  Hint: Look at the picture!


- Class: figure
  Output: Here's another one. More power curves.
  Figure: powerCurve_sigma.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: As variance increases, what happens to power?
  AnswerChoices: it increases; it decreases; it doesn't change
  CorrectAnswer: it decreases
  AnswerTests: word=it decreases
  Hint: Look at the picture!

- Class: figure
  Output: Here's another one. And even more power curves.
  Figure: powerCurve_alpha.R
  FigureType: new

- Class: mult_question
  Output: As alpha increases, what happens to power?
  AnswerChoices: it increases; it decreases; it doesn't change
  CorrectAnswer: it increases
  AnswerTests: word=it increases
  Hint: Look at the picture!

- Class: text
  Output: If H_a proposed that mu != mu_0 we would calculate the one sided power using alpha / 2 in the direction of mu_a (either less than or greater than mu_0). This is only approximately right, it excludes the probability of getting a large test statistic in the opposite direction of the truth.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Since power goes up as alpha gets larger would the power of a one-sided test be greater or less than the power of the associated two sided test?
  AnswerChoices: greater; less than; they're the same
  CorrectAnswer: greater
  AnswerTests: word=greater
  Hint: The quantity alpha is bigger than alpha/2 so it's got more power.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Finally, if H_a specified that mu < mu_0 could we still do the same kind of power calculations?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: word=Yes
  Hint: We just have to look at the right tail and flip all our reasoning.

- Class: text
  Output: Suppose H_a says that mu > mu_0. Then power = 1 - beta = Prob ( X' > mu_0 + z_(1-alpha) * sigma/sqrt(n)) assuming that X'~ N(mu_a,sigma^2/n). Which quantities do we know in this statement, given the context of the problem? Let's work through this.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the null hypothesis H_0 tell us that the population mean equals?
  AnswerChoices: mu_0; mu_a; beta; alpha
  CorrectAnswer: mu_0
  AnswerTests: word=mu_0
  Hint: H_0 simply proposes a null mean.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: After the null mean mu_0 is proposed what does the designer of the hypothesis test specify in order to reject or fail-to-reject H_0? In other words, what is the level size of the test?
  AnswerChoices: mu_0; mu_a; beta; alpha
  CorrectAnswer: alpha
  AnswerTests: word=alpha
  Hint: The level size is indicated by a Greek letter.

- Class: text
  Output: So we know that  the quantities mu_0 and alpha are specified by the test designer. In the statement 1 - beta = Prob( X' > mu_0 + z_(1-alpha) * sigma/sqrt(n)) given mu_a > mu_0, mu_0 and alpha are specified, and X' depends on the data. The other four quantities, (beta, sigma, n, and mu_a), are all unknown.

- Class: text
  Output: It should be obvious that specifying any three of these unknowns will allow us to solve for the missing fourth. Usually, you only try to solve for power (1-beta) or the sample size n.

- Class: text
  Output: An interesting point is that  power doesn't need mu_a, sigma and n individually.  Instead only sqrt(n)*(mu_a - mu_0) /sigma is needed. The quantity (mu_a - mu_0) / sigma is called the EFFECT SIZE. This is the difference in the means in standard deviation units. It is unit free so it can be interpreted in different settings.


- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you think will happen if you doubled sd to 2 and ran the same test?
  AnswerChoices: delta will double; delta will halve; delta won't change
  CorrectAnswer: delta will double
  AnswerTests: word=delta will double
  Hint: Since you're doubling the denominator (sd) you have to double the numerator (delta) in order to keep the effect size constant.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 1. The level of a test is specified by what?
  AnswerChoices:  alpha; beta; gamma; delta; None of the others
  CorrectAnswer: alpha
  AnswerTests: word=alpha
  Hint: The level refers to the probability of rejecting  the null hypothesis when it is true. This is the first Greek letter.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 2. What is a Type II error?
  AnswerChoices:   rejecting a true hypothesis;  rejecting a false hypothesis;  accepting a true hypothesis; accepting a false hypothesis
  CorrectAnswer: accepting a false hypothesis
  AnswerTests: word=accepting a false hypothesis
  Hint: Only two of the choices are errors. Eliminate those and then eliminate the Type I error.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 3. What is power?
  AnswerChoices: thrilling; alpha; beta; gamma; delta; None of the others
  CorrectAnswer: None of the others
  AnswerTests: word=None of the others
  Hint: Power is 1-beta. Is that in the list?

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 4. You're a perfectionist designing an experiment and you want both alpha and beta to be small. Can they both be 0 for this single test?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: No
  AnswerTests: word=No
  Hint: If alpha=0, then you ALWAYS fail to reject (that is, you accept) H_0; if H_0 is false, beta=1. Similarly if beta=0, you ALWAYS reject H_0; if H_0 is true then alpha=1.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 5. Suppose H_0 proposes mu = mu_0 and H_a proposes that mu < mu_0. You'll test a series of mu_a with power != alpha. Which of the following is NOT true?
  AnswerChoices: mu_0-mu_a > 0;  mu_a-mu_0 < 0; mu_a-mu_0=0 ; huh?
  CorrectAnswer: mu_a-mu_0=0
  AnswerTests: word=mu_a-mu_0=0
  Hint: As in the case in which H_a proposes that mu > mu_0, when mu_a=mu_0, alpha=power. This was excluded in the problem statement so mu_a=mu_0 cannot be true in this case.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 6. Suppose H_0 proposes mu = mu_0 and H_a proposes that mu < mu_0. Which of the following is true?
  AnswerChoices: the smaller mu_0-mu_a the more powerful the test; the smaller mu_a-mu_0 the more powerful the test; mu_0=mu_a maximizes the power
  CorrectAnswer: the smaller mu_a-mu_0 the more powerful the test
  AnswerTests: word=the smaller mu_a-mu_0 the more powerful the test
  Hint: Here mu_a < mu_0 and the smaller mu_a-mu_0 is, the easier it is to discriminate between mu_a and mu_0.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 7. Which expression represents the size effect?
  AnswerChoices: (mu_a - mu_0) / sigma; (mu_a - mu_0) / n; (mu_a - mu_0) / sqrt(sigma); (mu_a - mu_0) / sqrt(n)
  CorrectAnswer: (mu_a - mu_0) / sigma
  AnswerTests: word=(mu_a - mu_0) / sigma
  Hint: The size effect is the distance between the two proposed means in standard deviation units.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 8. True or False? More power is better than less power.
  AnswerChoices: True; False
  CorrectAnswer: True
  AnswerTests: word=True
  Hint: Power is good.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 9. True or False? A larger beta (call it beta_max) is more powerful than a smaller beta.
  AnswerChoices: True; False
  CorrectAnswer: False
  AnswerTests: word=False
  Hint: Recall that beta is the probability of an error (Type II), so you'd like a smaller beta.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: 10. True or False? The larger the sample size the less powerful the test.
  AnswerChoices: True; False
  CorrectAnswer: False
  AnswerTests: word=False
  Hint: It's usually better to have more data to work with.
